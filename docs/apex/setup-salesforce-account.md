To set up the developer account, we need to follow the following steps.

2. Fill the form by entering the valid Email ID. You will get your verification link to the email id.

9. We can create many things in the developer console like `Apex class,` `Apex Trigger,` `lightning component,` and etc. To create any of these things, we need to go first to the `File` option, then `New` and select the options based on our need, as shown below.
